						<h2><a href="#">Continuum Laparoscopic Robot: Design, Modeling, and Control </a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p><b>Description: </b>(a) A 6-DOF continuum laparoscope is designed, featuring RCM constraint-free, optical angle rotation and zoom capabilities, thereby reducing the difficulty of FOV adjustment from a mechanical design perspective (MMT 2024, IROS 2024, etc). 
						(b) GazeScope, a novel framework for automatic laparoscopic FoV adjustment, which considers gaze attention, the positions of surgical tools in the image, and the eye-hand consistency, is proposed to effectively and efficiently adjust the laparoscopic field-of-view (RAL 2025, Measurement 2025, etc). 
						(c) A teleoperation system is proposed that utilizes a single RGB camera and incorporates a motion mapping method addressing both end-effector tracking accuracy and optimal joint configuration imitation for the follower robotic arm/continuous robot (IROS 2025, etc). . 
						(d) A model-free controller for versatile continuum laparoscopic robots, which can directly map image features to joint-space commands, is currently in development (WIP). 
						(e) A magnetic sensor array-based method for estimating continuum robot configurations is currently in development as well (WIP).

					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/uav1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p><b>Description:  </b>Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as ubiquitous and agile robots and data carriers within the framework of the future Internet of 
						Things (IoT) and mobile wireless networks. Yet, the insufficient onboard battery necessitates the optimization of energy consumption for both the UAV and IoT devices 
						while ensuring that communication requirements are met. <b>Fig.A</b>: one-to-mult UAV assisted IoT networks. <b>Fig.B</b>: Simulation comparison of UAV trajectories 
						with different design approaches. <b>Fig.C</b>: Comparison with respect to energy consumption and completion time (Mathematics 2023, Sensors 2022, CAC 2021, etc). </p>

						interact with human and environment safely. Fluid power, both pneumatics and hydraulics, compared to other conventional actuation methods such as tendon or 
					shape memory alloy, has higher power density, higher efficiency, and higher bandwidth. <b>Fig.A</b>: A elbow-structured pneumatic actuator which can achieve linear motion.

					<p><b>Description: </b>Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system are two effective approaches to save heart failure patients. However, 
						critical components such as the pump damages the blood. Specifically, hemolysis, platelet activation, microparticle generation and von Willebrand factor (vWF) degradation.

					<p><b>Description: </b>Demonstration of MCS device hemocompatibility is required for regulatory approval and subsequent human clinical use. While testing the MCS device itself, 
						the additional loop components, such as connectors and loop geometry, would also lead to shear mediated blood damage. <b>Fig. A</b>: an in-vitro circulation loop with 90 
						deg angulation via heat-bending. <b>Fig.B</b>: an in-vitro circulation loop with 90 deg angulation via a T-connector. <b>Fig.C</b>: an in-vitro circulation loop with 5

						<h2><a href="#">Design of Novel MCS Devices and Hemocompatibility Tests</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/bloodpump.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p><b>Description: </b>While mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, i.e. ventricular assist devices (VADs) and total artificial hearts (TAHs), are vital in restoring 
						hemodynamics in patients with advanced heart failure, serving as either bridge to transplant or destination therapy, a significant number of adverse events have emerged 
						for device implanted patients. Many of the observed complications are due to chronic exposure to non-pulsatile flow and the high shear stress created by the current 
						method of blood propulsion or usage of prosthetic valves. <b>Fig.A</b>: A valveless pulsatile flow MCS design. <b>Fig.B</b>: A linear peristaltic MCS design. 
						<b>Fig.C</b>: A valveless compact MCS design. (iMech Part C 2023, Trans ASME-MD 2021, etc)</p>

						<h2><a href="#">Modeling of Interaction between Circulatory Support Device and Cardiovascular System </a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/circulationmodel1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p><b>Description: </b>Though mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts (TAH), provide heart failure patients 
						with bridges to heart transplantation or are alternatives to transplantation, device performance, and corresponding control strategies are often difficult to evaluate. 
						Therefore, proper models are needed to size the MCS device, to control the MCS device, and to modify the MCS device. <b>Fig.A&B</b>: A bond graph model of cardiovascular 
						system. <b>Fig.C</b>: PV loops of left and right atriums and ventricles. <b>Fig.D</b>: An in-vitro mock circulation device (AO 2019, etc). </p>

						<h2><a href="#">A Novel Alternating Flow Variable Displacement Hydraulic Pump </a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hydraulicpump.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p> <b>Description: </b>High power density, good controllability, and low cost are the most appealing characteristics that make hydraulic systems the best choice for many 
						applications. Current state-of-the-art hydraulic variable displacement pumps still suffers from 	low efficiency at low displacement. Therefore, novel variable 
						displacement hydraulic pump which has relative-high efficiency across a wide range of operation conditions is needed. <b>Fig<b>: A first generation prototype of 
							variable displacement alternating flow hydraulic pump (TMECH 2019, FPMC 2018/2017, DSCC 2017, etc). </p>
